        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>Our Principles</h2>
        <p>Audio To Text Transcription has designed this policy to be consistent with the following principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Privacy policies should be human readable and easy to find.</li>
          <li>
            Data collection, storage, and processing should be simplified as much as possible to enhance security, ensure
            consistency, and make the practices easy for users to understand.
          </li>
          <li>Data practices should meet the reasonable expectations of users.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We collect information in multiple ways, including when you provide information directly to us; when we
          passively collect information from you, such as from your browser or device; and from third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>Information You Provide Directly to Us</h3>
        <p>
          We will collect any information you provide to us. We may collect information from you in a variety of ways,
          such as when you: (a) create an online account, (b) make a donation or purchase, (c) contact us or provide
          feedback, or (d) subscribe to our newsletter. This information may include but is not limited to your name,
          email address, phone number, mailing address, payment information, and your geographic location.
        </p>

        <h3>Information that Is Automatically Collected</h3>
        <h4>Device/Usage Information</h4>
        <p>
          We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices or
          tablets) you use to access the Services. As described further below, we may collect and analyze (a) device
          information such as IP addresses, location information (by country and city), unique device identifiers,
          IMEI and TCP/IP address, browser types, browser language, operating system, mobile device carrier information,
          and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Services, such as referring and exit web
          pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and
          the order of those pages, statistical information about the use of the Services, the amount of time spent on
          particular pages, the date and time you used the Services, the frequency of your use of the Services, error
          logs, and other similar information. As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and
          technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.
        </p>

        <h4>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h4>
        <p>
          We also collect data about your use of the Services through the use of Internet server logs and online tracking
          technologies, like cookies and/or tracking pixels. A web server log is a file where website activity is stored.
          A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a website, that enables us to:
          (a) recognize your computer; (b) store your preferences and settings; (c) understand the web pages of the Services
          you have visited and the referral sites that have led you to our Services; (d) enhance your user experience by
          delivering content specific to your inferred interests; (e) perform searches and analytics; and (f) assist with
          security administrative functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique
          identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information
          like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising, and to access user
          cookies. We may also use tracking technologies in our license buttons and/or icons that you can embed on other
          sites/services to track the website addresses where they are embedded, gauge user interaction with them, and
          determine the number of unique viewers of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you receive email from us (such as newsletters, campaign updates, or other ongoing communications), we may use
          certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as whether you open our message, click on any
          links or banners our email contains, or otherwise interact with what we send. This data allows us to gauge the
          effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also
          gather additional information through other methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block
          cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information. Please note that by
          blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services. For more
          information about how we use cookies, please read our Cookie Policy.
        </p>

        <h3>Information from Third Parties</h3>
        <p>
          To the extent permitted by law, we may also collect information from third parties, including public sources,
          social media platforms, and marketing and market research firms. Depending on the source, this information
          collected from third parties could include name, contact information, demographic information, information about
          an individual’s employer, information to verify identity or trustworthiness, and information for other fraud or
          safety protection purposes.

        <h2>When We Disclose Your Information</h2>
        <p>We may disclose and/or share your information under the following circumstances:</p>
        <h3>Service Providers</h3>
        <p>
          We may disclose your information with third parties who perform services on our behalf, including without
          limitation, event management, marketing, customer support, data storage, data analysis and processing, and legal
          services.
        </p>

        <h3>Legal Compliance and Protection</h3>
        <p>
          We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or on a good faith belief that such disclosure is
          permitted by this Privacy Policy or reasonably necessary or appropriate for any of the following reasons:
          (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, or other
          contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) to enforce our policies;
          (d) to respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (e) to protect the rights, property, or personal
          safety of Audio To Text Transcription, our agents and affiliates, our users, and the public. This includes
          exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention,
          and similar purposes.
        </p>

        <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>
          As we continue to develop our business, we may engage in certain business transactions, such as the transfer or
          sale of our assets. In such transactions (including in contemplation of such transactions, e.g., due diligence)
          your information may be disclosed. If any of our assets are sold or transferred to a third party, customer
          information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.
        </p>

        <h3>Affiliated Companies</h3>
        <p>We may disclose your information with current or future affiliated companies.</p>

        <h3>Consent</h3>
        <p>We may disclose your information to any third parties based on your consent to do so.</p>

        <h3>Aggregate/De-identified Information</h3>
        <p>
          We may disclose de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose to third parties, including advertisers,
          promotional partners, and/or others.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or
          disclose information that can be directly linked to or used to identify you. To the extent those laws apply, our
          legal grounds for processing such information are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>To Honor Our Contractual Commitments to You.</strong> Much of our processing of information is to meet
            our contractual obligations to provide services to our users.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> In many cases, we handle information on the ground that it furthers our
            legitimate interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
            affected individuals. These include customer service, marketing, advertising, fundraising, protecting our users,
            personnel, and property, managing user accounts, organizing events and programs, analyzing and improving our
            business, and managing legal issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Compliance.</strong> We may need to use and disclose information in certain ways to comply with
            our legal obligations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent.</strong> Where required by law, and in some other cases where legally permissible, we handle
            information on the basis of consent. Where we handle your information on the basis of consent, you have the right
            to withdraw your consent in accordance with applicable law.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Online Analytics</h2>
        <p>
          We may use third-party web analytics services (such as Google Analytics) on our Services to collect and analyze
          the information discussed above, and to engage in auditing, research, or reporting. The information (including
          your IP address) collected by various analytics technologies described in the “Cookies and Other Tracking
          Technologies” section above will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the
          information to evaluate your use of the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you
          arrive to our site, analyzing usage trends, assisting with fraud prevention, and providing certain features to you.
          To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the official Google
          Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Your Choices and Data Subject Rights</h2>
        <p>You have various rights with respect to the collection and use of your information through the Services:</p>
        <h3>Email Unsubscribe</h3>
        <p>
          You may unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of
          each newsletter or by emailing <a href="mailto:kosurij.dm@gmail.com">kosurij.dm@gmail.com</a> with your request.
        </p>

        <h3>Account Preferences</h3>
        <p>
          If you have registered for an account with us through our Services, you can update your account information or
          adjust your email communications preferences by logging into your account and updating your settings.
        </p>

        <h3>EU Data Subject Rights</h3>
        <p>
          Individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and other jurisdictions have certain legal rights (subject to
          applicable exceptions and limitations) to obtain confirmation of whether we hold certain information about them,
          to access such information, and to obtain its correction or deletion in appropriate circumstances. You may have
          the right to object to our handling of your information, restrict our processing of your information, and to
          withdraw any consent you have provided. To exercise these rights, please email us at
          <a href="mailto:kosurij.dm@gmail.com">kosurij.dm@gmail.com</a> with the nature of your request. You also have the
          right to go directly to the relevant supervisory or legal authority, but we encourage you to contact us so that we
          may resolve your concerns directly as best and as promptly as we can.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          As described above in the “When We Disclose Your Information” section, we may share your information with trusted
          service providers or business partners in countries other than your country of residence in accordance with
          applicable law. This means that some of your information may be processed in countries that may not offer the same
          level of protection as the privacy laws of your jurisdiction. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge
          any such transfer, storage or use.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we provide any information about you to any third-party information processors located outside of the EEA, we
          will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this
          Privacy Policy and other data protection laws to govern the transfers of such data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Security Measures</h2>
        <p>
          We have implemented technical, physical, and organizational security measures to protect against the loss, misuse,
          and/or alteration of your information. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we
          collect and store. However, we cannot and do not guarantee that these measures will prevent every unauthorized
          attempt to access, use, or disclose your information since despite our efforts, no Internet and/or other electronic
          transmissions can be completely secure.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>
          The Services are intended for users over the age of 18 and are not directed at children under the age of 13. If we
          become aware that we have collected personal information (as defined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
          Act) from children under the age of 13, or personal data (as defined by the EU GDPR) from children under the age of
          16, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as practicable.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain the information we collect for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set forth in this Privacy
          Policy or as long as we are legally required or permitted to do so. Information may persist in copies made for
          backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
        <p>
          The Services may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., social media sites like Facebook and Twitter),
          third-party plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “like” button and Twitter “follow” button), and other services. If you
          choose to use these sites or features, you may disclose your information not just to those third parties, but also
          to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function. Audio To Text Transcription
          is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such third-party websites or services. The collection,
          use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third-party websites or
          services, and not this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every site you visit.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy as we update and expand our Services, and we may make changes to
          the Privacy Policy accordingly. We will post any changes here and revise the date last updated above. We encourage
          you to check this page periodically for updates to stay informed on how we collect, use, and share your information.
          If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with notice as required by law.
